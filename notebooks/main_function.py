MAIN FUNCTION - PLEASE DO NOT EDIT

    So in this function I will call functions that we have created so far with the goal of creating a database we can later manipulate:
    - data_mining_google_api.py - returns 4 csv's and an html file with all information regarding the a KEYWORD that is searched for
    - scrape_gm.py - allows us to obtain detailed information about the site such as occupancy rate, if required, it returns a csv file with "search code" and weekly occupancy for each
